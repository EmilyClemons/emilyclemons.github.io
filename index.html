                      Audry F. still goes to work as Jim, the man her coworkers have known for years. Despite coming out as transgender, she still feels uncomfortable coming to work as herself. “After I came out at work, I thought there would be a line of people wanting to talk to me and ask me questions,” she said, “but that hasn’t happened.” Pictures of Audry are in plain view at her cubicle in the Chicago IT office, but her coworkers seem uninterested in – or afraid of – talking to her about it. This, in turn, has made Audry feel unwelcome at work.

                  Creating a transgender-inclusive work environment, according to trans workplace issues expert Vanessa Sheridan Chicago’s Center on Halsted, is in a business’s best interest far beyond complying with non-discrimination laws. Trans-inclusive workplaces see better teamwork and higher productivity, according to Sheridan, which in turn leads to greater profitability. Here’s what you can do to improve your business and the lives of your employees:
                </p>

                <section>

                  <h3>
                    DO'S
                  </h3>

                  <p>
                    <em>Do implement Sheridan’s Five Fundamentals.</em>
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    These fundamentals ensure that your trans employees get the structural support they need to be their authentic selves, inside the office and out:
                  </p>

                  <ol>
                    <li>trans-inclusive policies and guidelines</li>
                    <li>set an inclusive dress code</li>
                    <li>have a trans-inclusive healthcare plan</li>
                    <li>offer trans-friendly accommodations, such as bathrooms</li>
                    <li>accommodate the gender-realignment process</li>
                  </ol>

                  <p>
                    With these fundamentals as a base, you can build an inclusive workplace from the ground up.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    “It’s a question of initially recognizing and respecting an individual’s right to self-identify,” says Sheridan. “Once you get past that, then everything else begins to fall into place.”
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    <em>Do educate yourself about transgender people.</em>
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    No matter which policies you implement, you still won’t be an effective ally and compassionate leader if you do not understand what your trans employees are experiencing. Start with a simple Google search, or take it a step further and consult a transgender person or expert. A little learning can go a long way!
                  </p>

                  <h3>
                    DON'TS
                  </h3>

                    <p>
                      <em>Don’t be afraid to ask questions.</em>
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      When Audry came out at work, she was excited to talk to her coworkers about her experience and educate them about the trans phenomenon. Their silence made her feel as though coming to work as herself was not an option.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      Ask questions, and lend your coworker your support, but make sure you are asking appropriate questions. Stay away from personal physical questions, including topics such as genitalia and surgical gender realignment.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      <em>Don’t focus on personal beliefs when dealing with conflict.</em>
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      When handling situations with hostile or uncomfortable coworkers, do not try to change their views about transgender people. Instead, focus on workplace expectations, such as kindness and respect. This ensures a consistent standard about workplace behavior that everyone in the office can abide by, regardless of what identities they may hold.
                    </p>
